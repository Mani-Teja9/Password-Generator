🔐 Project Showcase: Password Generator 🔐

I'm excited to share my latest project: a Password Generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool features a user-friendly interface and customizable options, allowing users to select the password length and include/exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
